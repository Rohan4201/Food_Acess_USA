 This repository contains the final report submission to the **Fall Data Challenge 2021** conducted by **This is Statistics**. The project describes relevant metrics that could shed some insights on food access issues in US (and later particularly in Louisiana)

**This repo is currently not complete yet. The complete data files as well as the R scripts and the visualisations produced will be made available soon**
